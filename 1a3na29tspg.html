Here, the specification, the reason they used it and the main results&nbsp;are&nbsp;briefly mentioned.&nbsp;</div><ol><li><b>Heterogeneity by income and urban residence.&nbsp;</b>By predicting family income based on observable demographic characteristics and family income in the 1915 Iowa census, the sample is split into low income and high income based on deviation from the median predicted income. Comparing rejected and accepted families across the two groups yields 15% higher increase in longevity for the low income individuals compared to the high income ones (not statistically significant results). After splitting into 3 groups by child age, large but not statistically significant results are found for younger children. Furthermore, the residential area is put under investigation, given the fact that counties had the administrative power in the MP program. Splitting the sample into above and below median share urban, no significant difference in size is observed between the two samples.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><b>Discrimination and the composition of rejected applicants.&nbsp;</b>To test their identification strategy, the authors examine if there are unobservable characteristics such as race and nativity, that can negatively correlate with children outcomes through discrimination. Although the US Department of Labor estimated that 96% of the MP recipients were white, linking a subset of the records with WWII enlistment and 1940 census data that contain race did not show that blacks were more likely to be rejected. Furthermore, the Department of Labor reposted lack of discrimination in 1931 for Ohio. Discrimination towards nativity was also not found, however, there exist contradictory reports arguing each side. Matching with different sources for finding nativity and dropping individuals subsequently by age of the child, family size does not suggest any type of different treatment between the groups.</li><li><b>Aggregate results.</b> Estimated models with aggregated data on county level, year of application and year of birth by regressing the fraction surviving past age 70 on fraction accepted did not yield significantly different results whether using weights or controls. This robustness check excludes the possibility of counties with high rejection rates to drive the results. </li><li><b>Results for Ohio.</b> Since 34% of the sample originates from Ohio, where black mothers received benefits at expected rates, and the applicants were not required to be U.S&nbsp;</li><li><b>Attrition and multiple matches.</b>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Alternative </b><b>counterfactulas</b><b>.&nbsp;</b></li></ol><h3 data-label="211233" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h1 data-label="584198" class="ltx_title_section">5.
