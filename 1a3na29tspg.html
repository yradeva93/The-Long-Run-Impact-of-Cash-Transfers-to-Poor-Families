<h2 data-label="652272" class="ltx_title_subsection">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2 Robustness checks</h2><div>In order to confirm their results, the authors use various specifications. Here, the specification, the reason they used it and the main results&nbsp;are&nbsp;briefly mentioned.&nbsp;</div><ol><li><b>Heterogeneity by income and urban residence.&nbsp;</b>By predicting family income based on observable demographic characteristics and family income in the 1915 Iowa census, the sample is split into low income and high income based on deviation from the median predicted income. Comparing rejected and accepted families across the two groups yields 15% higher increase in longevity for the low income individuals compared to the high income ones (not statistically significant results). After splitting into 3 groups by child age, large but not statistically significant results are found for younger children. Furthermore, the residential area is put under investigation, given the fact that counties had the administrative power in the MP program. Splitting the sample into above and below median share urban, no significant difference in size is observed between the two samples.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><b>Discrimination and the composition of rejected applicants.&nbsp;</b>To test their identification strategy, the authors examine if there are unobservable characteristics such as race and nativity, that can negatively correlate with children outcomes through discrimination. Although the US Department of Labor estimated that 96% of the MP recipients were white, linking a subset of the records with WWII enlistment and 1940 census data that contain race did not show that blacks were more likely to be rejected. Furthermore, the Department of Labor reposted lack of discrimination in 1931 for Ohio. Discrimination towards nativity was also not found, however, there exist contradictory reports arguing each side. Matching with different sources for finding nativity and dropping individuals subsequently by age of the child, family size does not suggest any type of different treatment between the groups.</li><li><b>Aggregate results.</b> Estimated models with aggregated data on county level, year of application and year of birth by regressing the fraction surviving past age 70 on fraction accepted did not yield significantly different results whether using weights or controls. This robustness check excludes the possibility of counties with high rejection rates to drive the results. </li><li><b>Results for Ohio.</b> Since 34% of the sample originates from Ohio, where black mothers received benefits at expected rates, the applicants were not required to be U.S&nbsp;citizens, and there is availability of data on other social programs taking place at the same time. Results remain&nbsp;robust but slightly larger. Hence, discrimination and availability of other programs are not biasing the results.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Attrition and multiple matches.</b>&nbsp;Given the different rate of attrition between rejected and accepted applicants (51% vs. 45% respectively), the authors want to show that this is due to mortality rather than other factors. Further analysis on the lifetables shows that the magnitude of the attrition is consistent with the magnitude of the mortality rates. Matching with retrospective pre-application records indicates that differences in the names of accepted and rejected applicants do not have an effect on the match rate. Lastly, the rate of multiple matches is the same across the two samples. Additional death records are collected for the state of Ohio, where further analysis shows that the rejected applicants did die younger than the accepted ones, which confirms the assumption that the difference in the matching rates is due to mortality. The results are also not sensitive to the treatment of multiple matches.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Alternative counterfactulas.&nbsp;</b>Two alternative control groups are constructed from 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930 census matched with their DMF records. Orphans - children living in institutions are an appropriate historical counterfactual as one of the purposes of the MP program is to prevent the institutionalization of children. This group is very similar to rejected applicants with regard to longevity, confirming the findings that they live shorter lives than accepted applicants. The second control group considered here are single or divorced mothers, not eligible for the MP program according to the laws of some states. Comparing these children to children whose fathers were disabled or institutionalized found the same results as the main analysis. Children of accepted mothers lived longer compared to the control group.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>All robustness checks support the original findings of the authors and hence, strenghten the reliability of the main findings of the paper.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="211233" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h1 data-label="584198" class="ltx_title_section">5.
