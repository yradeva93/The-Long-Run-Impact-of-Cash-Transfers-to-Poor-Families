The above specification presents a good overview of the total effect of the program on longevity but fails to deal with attrition and assumes a specific form on the shape of the hazard rate. Hence, the following logit model analy of the probability ($P$) of surviving past age $a$ for a given individual is represented by:
$$
P(survived\,to\,age\,a=1)_{iftcs} = f(\theta_0 + \theta_1MP_f + \theta_2\mathbf{X}_{if} + \theta_3\mathbf{Z}_{st} + \mathbf{\theta}_c + \mathbf{\theta}_t + \epsilon_{if})
$$
