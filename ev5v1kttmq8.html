<div>&nbsp;Panel B of Table 4 presents the results from the Logit model. Under the assumption that those who without a match died until the age of 60 ((1)-(4)) and dropping all of them in specification (5), the role of attrition can be assessed. The probability of surviving past the age of 70 increases significantly for all specifications and is estimated to have a percent effect of 11% - 19%. However, for completeness, the arbitrary cut-offs are abandoned and Figure 1 shows the estimation of the survival model using age at death between 58 and 88 (10th and 90th percentiles&nbsp;of the distribution of the age at death). The marginal effects (as a percentage of the survival rate of rejected applicants) a</div><div></div>
