<div>&nbsp;Panel B of Table 4 presents the results from the Logit model. Under the assumption that those without a match died until the age of 60 ((1)-(4)) and dropping all of them in specification (5), the role of attrition can be examined. The probability of surviving past the age of 70 increases significantly for all specifications and is estimated to have a percent effect of 11% - 19%. However, for completeness, the arbitrary cut-offs are abandoned and the survival model is estimated using age at death between 58 and 88 (10th and 90th percentiles&nbsp;of the distribution of the age at death). The marginal effects (as a percentage of the survival rate of rejected applicants) are computed using the coefficients from the Logit model. All of them are positive and, after the age of 67, are positive and significant in both the full and the matched sample.</div><div></div>
