This model asses the effect of the MP program on the natural logarithm of the age at death for a given individual $i$ in family $f$ born in year $t$, living in county $c$ (state $s$) and has the following functional form:
$$
log(Age\,at\,death)_{ifts} = \theta_0 + \theta_1MP_f + \theta_2\mathbf{X}_{if} + \theta_3\mathbf{Z}_{st} + \mathbf{\theta}_c + \mathbf{\theta}_t + \epsilon_{if}
$$
, where $\theta_1$ is the effect of the program, identified by comparing the average age at death of accepted to rejected boys within county and year of birth, conditional on other observables. $MP_f$ indicates whether the child's mother received MP benefits, $\mathbf{X}$ is a vector of individual and family characteristics, \mathbf{Z} represents cou
