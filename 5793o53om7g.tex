log(Age\,at\,death)_{ifts} = \theta_0 + \theta_1MP_f + \theta_2\mathbf{X}_{if} + \theta_3\mathbf{Z}_{st} + \mathbf{\theta}_c + \mathbf{\theta}_t + \epsilon_{if}

, where $\theta_1$ is the effect of the program, identified by comparing the average age at death of accepted to rejected boys within county and year of birth, conditional on other observables.
