<h1 data-label="538103" class="ltx_title_section">1. Introduction&nbsp;</h1><div>Early-life exposure to factors associated with poverty is shown to have adverse long-term effects on labor market outcomes, educational attainment, and mortality&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Almond_2011}</cite>. Hence, many welfare programs are established to alleviate these effects and help children. Evidence suggests that parental income is one of the strongest predictors of one's educational attainment&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barrow_2012}</cite> and health&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Case_2002}</cite>. However, the question of whether these cash transfers to poor families impact children’s longevity, educational attainment, income,&nbsp;and health was not yet answered.</div><div>The difficulty in assessing programs as such arises from the many reasons why cash transfers could potentially fail to help children. Furthermore, from an evaluation point of view identifying a plausible counterfactual (i.e. the outcome in the absence of the treatment) is difficult as much as obtaining data on long-term outcomes. The authors manage to tackle these difficulties by collecting administrative records from the Mothers' Pension (MP) program (1911-1935) - the first US government-sponsored program targeting mothers with dependent children. As individuals were not eligible for other programs, the analysis manages to isolate the effect of the unconditional cash transfers.&nbsp;</div><div>To investigate the long-term outcomes, they track longevity, educational attainment, health and labor market outcomes of the children of accepted and rejected applicants. Using the children of mothers who applied and were deemed eligible but later rejected as a counterfactual, the effect on longevity was estimated to be approximately a 1-year increase for the children of accepted mothers. This effect is greater for the poorest families and very robust to alternative functional form specifications, alternative counterfactual comparisons, and treatment of attrition. Furthermore, to examine the mechanisms through which longevity increases, different channels are investigated through matching the MP data with WWII enlistment and 1940 census records. Results yield that cash transfers reduced the probability of being underweight, increased educational attainment by 0.34 years, and increased income by 14 %.&nbsp;</div><div>The analysis excludes females as they are harder to follow, given that they often change their names after marriage and due to their bad representation, African-Americans they are also not studied. Moreover, the study suffers from attrition, which is tackled and does not bias the results. </div><div>In conclusion, the authors claim that these unconditional cash transfers manage to improve early life conditions enough to improve medium- and long-term outcomes. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="831783" class="ltx_title_section">2. Data</h1><h2 data-label="418670" class="ltx_title_subsection">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 Mothers' Pension program</h2><div>The MP program is a Needs-based program in the US, taking part in 1911 until it is replaced by the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) in 1935. The program targets female-headed households, where the breadwinner is diseased, imprisoned or dead. Most of the dependent children were sent to orphanages and they were shown to fare very poorly&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hopkins2011}</cite>. Hence, the main aim of the program was to provide home care by the mother instead of the child to be sent to an institution or the mother to be forced into full-time employment. In terms of size, the program was comprised of 10-30$ per month, which represented 29-39% of maternal income. As the time span and eligibility differed by state, the average duration of the program was 3 years and the eligibility was controlled for in the further analysis. All states required that the mother is poor and the husband is either missing or incapacitated. The most common cause of discontinuation was remarriage and therefore, the program should be considered as an unconditional transfer, rather than being contingent on a specific action by the recipient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="511020" class="ltx_title_subsection">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 Sample selection and matching</h2><div>The analysis is limited to males because females are harder to follow through time due to changing their name after marriage.
