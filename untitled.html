<h1 data-label="538103" class="ltx_title_section">1. Introduction&nbsp;</h1><div>Early-life exposure to factors associated with poverty is shown to have adverse long-term effects on labor market outcomes, educational attainment, and mortality&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Almond_2011}</cite>. Hence, many welfare programs are established to alleviate these effects and help children. Evidence suggests that parental income is one of the strongest predictors of one's educational attainment&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barrow_2012}</cite> and health&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Case_2002}</cite>. However, the question of whether these cash transfers to poor families impact childrenâ€™s longevity, educational attainment, income,&nbsp;and health is not yet answered.</div><div>The difficulty in assessing programs as such arises from the many reasons why cash transfers could potentially fail to help children. Furthermore, from an evaluation point of view identifying a plausible counterfactual (i.e. the outcome in the absence of the treatment) is as difficult as obtaining data on long-term outcomes. The authors manage to tackle these difficulties by collecting administrative records from the Mothers' Pension (MP) program (1911-1935) - the first US government-sponsored program targeting mothers with dependent children. As individuals were not eligible for other programs at the time, the analysis manages to isolate the effect of the unconditional cash transfers.&nbsp;</div><div>To investigate the long-term outcomes, they track longevity, educational attainment, health and labor market outcomes of the children of accepted and rejected applicants. Using the children of mothers who applied and were deemed eligible but later rejected as a counterfactual, the effect on longevity was estimated to be approximately a 1-year increase for the children of accepted mothers. This effect is greater for the poorest families and very robust to alternative functional form specifications, alternative counterfactual comparisons, and treatment of attrition. Furthermore, to examine the mechanisms through which longevity increases, different channels are investigated through matching the MP data with WWII enlistment and 1940 census records. Results yield that cash transfers reduced the probability of being underweight, increased educational attainment by 0.34 years, and increased income by 14 %.&nbsp;</div>
