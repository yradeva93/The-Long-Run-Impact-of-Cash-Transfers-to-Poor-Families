Introduction&nbsp;</h1><div>Early-life exposure to factors associated with poverty are shown to have adverse long-term effects on labor market outcomes, educational attainment and mortality&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Almond_2011}</cite>. Hence, many welfare programs are establish to alleviate these effects and help children. Evidence suggest that parental income is one of the strongest predictors of one's educational attainment&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barrow_2012}</cite> and health&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Case_2002}</cite>. However, the question of weather these cash transfers to poor families impact children’s longevity, educational attainment, income,&nbsp;and health was not yet answered.</div><div>The difficulty in assessing programs as such arises form the many reasons why cash transfers could potentially fail to help children. Furthermore, from an evaluation point of view identifying a plausible counterfactual (i.e. the outcome in the absence of the treatment) is&nbsp; difficult as much as obtaining data on long-term outcomes. The authors manage to tackle these difficulties by collecting administrative records from the Mothers' Pension (MP) program (1911-1935) - the first US government-sponsored program targeting mothers with dependent children (later the ADC, AFDC, and now TANF programs). To investigate the long-term outcomes, they track longevity </div><div>Identifies a plausible counterfactual. Data on long-term outcomes. No eligibility for other programs.
