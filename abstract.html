<div>A. Aizer, S. Eli, J. Ferrie, and A. Lleras-Muney estimate the long-run impact of unconditional cash transfers on children's longevity, income, health and educational attainment. They used individual-level data of the Mothers' Pension program and matched it to Census, WWII&nbsp; data, and DMF (Death Master File) records. The results suggest that compared to children of rejected mothers, an accepted male child lived one year longer, obtained one-third more years of schooling, was less likely to be underweight, and had higher income.</div>
