<div><div>The expected decrease in mortality through the channel of malnutrition is rather small, given the fact that only 10% of the subsample is underweight, although the overall effect is big in size considering the relative risk of mortality ranges from 1.38 to 2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176950/articles/213251-the-long-run-impact-of-cash-transfers-to-poor-families#Flegal_2005">(Flegal 2005</a>). Looking at the estimates of education and income, they have higher explanatory power in this particular situation. That suggests a 30% increase in income would lower mortality by 10%. increasing longevity by 0.9 years. Furthermore, an increase in </div><div>schooling</div><div>of 0.25 years is associated with a 0.15 years increase in longevity. In conclusion, participation in the MP program would result in at least one additional year of longevity, consistent with the previous results from Table 4 of 1.1-1.4 years. Which leads to these mechanisms explaining 75-95 % of the increase in life expectancy.&nbsp;</div></div><h1 data-label="560703" class="ltx_title_section">6. Interpretation and Policy Relevance</h1><div><div>The study finds that participation in the MP program increases longevity, possibly through the mechanisms examined in the paper: income, education, and health. The results depend heavily on the counterfactual chosen for the study. The results are supported with "Cash transfers to poor families ameliorated early life conditions enough to improve both&nbsp;medium-<span>&nbsp;and long-term outcomes of boys growing up in poverty."&nbsp; First assessment of unconditional cash transfers. A new approach for identification and long-term data accessibility. Short- and medium-term effects are in line with contemporary research about the impact of cash transfers on education and health outcomes.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div></div><h1 data-label="400053" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="400053" class="ltx_title_section">7.
