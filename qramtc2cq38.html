<div>, where all other covariates are defined as before. The model accounts for attrition by imputing zero for the unmatched individuals in the DMF under the assumption that all those without a match were deceased. Following a comparison between the "matched sample" and the "full-sample",&nbsp;If the missing data is entirely explained by early mortality then the full-sample estimates will be correct. To account for the 4% multiple matches in the sample, the estimation procedure by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Honore_2004}</cite> is adopted.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="821248" class="ltx_title_subsection">&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 Identification</h2><div>The identification strategy in this paper uses the children of rejected but eligible applicants as a counterfactual (also used in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bound_1989,Wachter_2011}</cite>). It relies heavily on the assumption that accepted and rejected applicants are similar on observable and unobservable characteristics. This assumption is plausible given the fact that both groups were aware of the program (unobservable characteristics) and applied (unobservable), they were eligible in the beginning and were probably facing similar economic conditions (observable characteristics). However, at a later stage, the rejected ones were not deemed eligible anymore. To investigate this further the authors performed various tests such&nbsp;as Between-groups comparison;&nbsp; Comparison of pretreatment characteristics between groups; Examination of reasons for rejection and discontinuation.</div><div><div>The observable characteristics of the two groups look similar but are not identical. Rejected applicants were on average older and from smaller families. Furthermore, the exact birth date of accepted individuals is more likely to be missing, which could be taken as a marker of illiteracy. The 1915 Iowa census data is then used to assess whether differences in family characteristics correlate with differences in family income. After predicting average income for accepted and rejected applicants by characteristics such as family size, age&nbsp;of siblings, maternal marital status and</div><div><div>&nbsp;length of&nbsp;family name&nbsp;<span>, the results yield that accepted individuals had 7-9% lower family income than rejected. The statistically significant differences between accepted and rejected applicants at this stage of the analysis suggest&nbsp;that&nbsp;the accepted mothers came from slightly worse=off families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</div><div>The next step of the analysis involves matching the MP records with two subsamples of the census data prior to the application in order to obtain information about pretreatment characteristics. Although these measures are actual and not predicted they were taken when fathers participated in the household and not at the time of application when the father is no longer present. Hence, the measures might not be representative of the family circumstances at the time of application. Keeping that in mind, the results are still meaningful and hint that accepted boys come on average from poorer families.</div><div>The third step of comparison between the two samples is to examine the reasons for rejection and discontinuation. By examining the administrative records, the main reason for rejection was insufficient need (35%), marriage or remarriage (8%), and observed sufficient funds (as in Clay County, MN and Cook County).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>All three analysis support the assumption that accepted and rejected applicants do not differ significantly from each other. The differences are small and concentrate on the fact that the accepted are slightly poorer.&nbsp; The analysis proceeds under the assumption that mean comparisons between these groups represents a lower bound on the effect of the program.</div></div><div></div></div><h1 data-label="293785" class="ltx_title_section">4.
