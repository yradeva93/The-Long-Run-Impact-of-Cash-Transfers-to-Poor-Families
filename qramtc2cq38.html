The model accounts for attrition by imputing zero for the unmatched individuals in the DMF under the assumption that all those without a match were deceased. Following a comparison between the "matched sample" and the "full-sample",&nbsp;If the missing data is entirely explained by early mortality then the full-sample estimates will be correct.
