<div>, where all other covariates are defined as before. The model accounts for attrition by imputing zero for the unmatched individuals in the DMF under the assumption that all those without a match were deceased. Following a comparison between the "matched sample" and the "full-sample",&nbsp;If the missing data is entirely explained by early mortality then the full-sample estimates will be correct. To account for the 4 % multiple matches in the sample, the estimation procedure by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Honore_2004}</cite> is adopted.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="821248" class="ltx_title_subsection">&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3 Identification</h2><div>The identification strategy in this paper uses the children of rejected but eligible applicants as a counterfactual (also used in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bound_1989,Wachter_2011}</cite>). It relies heavily on the assumption that accepted and rejected applicants are similar on observable and unobservable characteristics. This assumption is plausible given the fact that both groups were aware of the program and applied (unobservable), they were eligible in the beginning&nbsp; and were probably facing similar economic conditions (obs. However, at a later stage, the rejected ones were not deemed eligible anymore. To investigate this further the author performed various tests. Testing the assumption:• Compare characteristics between groups• Compare pretreatment characteristics between groups• Examination of reasons for rejection and discontinuation.</div><h1 data-label="293785" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="293785" class="ltx_title_section">4.
