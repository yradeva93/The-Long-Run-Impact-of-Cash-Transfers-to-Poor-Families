Data</h2><h2 data-label="418670" class="ltx_title_subsection">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 Mothers' Pension program</h2><div>The MP program is a needs-based program in the US, taking place in 1911 until it is replaced by the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) in 1935. The program targets female-headed households, where the breadwinner is diseased, imprisoned or dead. At the time most of the dependent children were sent to orphanages and were shown to fare very poorly&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hopkins2011}</cite>. Hence, the main aim of the program was to provide home care by the mother instead of the child to be sent to an institution or the mother to be forced into full-time employment. In terms of size, the program was around 10-30$ per month, which represented 29-39% of maternal income. As the time span and eligibility differed by state, the average duration of the program was 3 years and the eligibility is controlled for in the further analysis. All states required that the mother is poor and the husband is either missing or incapacitated. The most common cause of discontinuation was remarriage and therefore, the program should be considered as an unconditional transfer, rather than being contingent on a specific action by the recipient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="511020" class="ltx_title_subsection">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 Sample selection and matching</h2><div>The analysis is limited to males because females are harder to follow through time due to changing their name after marriage. Furthermore, more data restrictions are implemented to increase the quality of the data such as the removal of individuals without dates of birth and with missing first and/or last name. The working sample from the MP records contains 16 000 males from 75 counties in 11 states, who were born between 1900 and 1925. Of those,&nbsp; 14% were rejected applicants who passed a preliminary evaluation but were rejected at a later stage due to a non-sufficient need of the program. The MP records are then matched to a&nbsp; Social Security Death Master File (DMF) from 1975 - 2012 in order to get longevity data. For the analysis of income in adulthood and educational attainment, the census records from 1940 are used. The data is further matched with World War II enlistment (WWII) from 1938 - 1946 to account for health outcomes of the children of accepted and rejected mothers. The data suffers from attrition, however, it is assumed that it is mortality-driven.&nbsp; 48% of the individuals were matched to a unique death record, 4% were matched to multiple death records and&nbsp; 48% were not matched. Using live tables, the authors calculate longevity and take all of the individuals prior to 1975 as death in the follow-up analysis.&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="280910" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="280910" class="ltx_title_section">3.
